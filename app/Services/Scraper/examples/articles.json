            "rendered": "<p id=\"speakable-summary\">My MacBook Pro is three years old, and for the first time in my life, a three-year-old primary computer doesn&#8217;t feel like a crisis which must be resolved immediately. True, this is partly because I&#8217;m waiting for Apple to fix their <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jeredfloyd\/status\/1189945790795538432\">keyboard debacle<\/a>, and partly because I still cannot stomach the Touch Bar. But it is also because three years of performance growth ain&#8217;t what it used to be.<\/p>\n<p>It is no exaggeration to say that Moore&#8217;s Law, the mindbogglingly relentless exponential growth in our world&#8217;s computing power, has been the most significant force in the world for the last fifty years. So its slow <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nextbigfuture.com\/2019\/02\/the-end-of-moores-law-in-detail-and-starting-a-new-golden-age.html\">deceleration<\/a> and\/or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/moores-law-is-dead-nvidias-ceo-jensen-huang-says-at-ces-2019\/\">demise<\/a> are a big deal, and not just because the repercussions are now making their way into every home and every pocket.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve all lived in hope that some other field would go exponential, giving us another, similar, era, of course. AI\/machine learning was the great hope, especially the distant dream of a machine-learning feedback loop, AI improving AI at an exponential pace for decades. That now seems awfully unlikely.<\/p>\n<p>In truth it always did. A couple of years ago I was talking to the CEO of an AI company who argued that AI progress was basically an S-curve, and we had already reached its top for sound processing, were nearing it for image and video, but were only halfway up the curve for text. No prize for guessing which one his company specialized in &#8212; but it seems to have been entirely correct.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this week OpenAI <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/OpenAI\/status\/1192481690741903360\">released<\/a> an <a href=\"https:\/\/openai.com\/blog\/ai-and-compute\/\">update to their analysis from last year<\/a> regarding how the computing power used by AI<sup>1<\/sup> is increasing. The outcome? It &#8220;has been increasing exponentially with a 3.4-month doubling time (by comparison, Moore\u2019s Law had a 2-year doubling period).  Since 2012, this metric has grown by more than 300,000x (a 2-year doubling period would yield only a 7x increase).&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s &#8230; a lot of computing power to improve the state of the AI art, and it&#8217;s clear that this growth in compute cannot continue. Not &#8220;will not&#8221;; <em>can<\/em> not. Sadly, the exponential growth in the need for computing power to train AI has happened almost exactly contemporaneously with the diminishment of the exponential growth of Moore&#8217;s Law. Throwing more money at the problem won&#8217;t help &#8212; again, we&#8217;re talking about exponential rates of growth here, linear expense adjustments won&#8217;t move the needle.<\/p>\n<p>The takeaway is that, even if we assume great efficiency breakthroughs and performance improvements to reduce the rate of doubling, AI progress seems to be increasingly compute-limited at a time when our collective growth in computing power is beginning to falter. Perhaps there&#8217;ll be some sort of breakthrough, but in the absence of one, it sounds a whole lot like we&#8217;re looking at AI\/machine-learning progress leveling off, not long from now, and for the foreseeable future.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><sup>1<\/sup>It measures &#8220;the largest AI training runs,&#8221; technically, but this seems trend-instructive.<\/p>\n",

            "rendered": "<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.voiscooters.com\/\">Voi Technology<\/a>, the \u201cmicro-mobility\u201d startup that operates an e-scooter service in a 38 cities across 10 European countries, has raised an $85 million in Series B funding.<\/p>\n<p>Backing the round is a mixture of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/03\/voi-technology-the-european-e-scooter-rentals-startup-raises-an-additional-30m\/\">existing<\/a> and new investors. They include Balderton Capital, Creandum, Project A, JME Ventures, Raine Ventures, Kreos Capital, Inbox Capital, Rider Global, and Black Ice Capital. The new funding brings the total raised by Voi to $136 million.<\/p>\n<p>Eagled-eyed readers will have noticed that, based on our previous Voi coverage, the total figure is $32 million short. That&#8217;s because not all of Voi&#8217;s previous <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/11\/18\/hold-on-tight\/\">Series A commitment<\/a> was cashed in after the company was offered more favourable terms for its $30 million Series A extension and therefore elected not to draw down the second tranche of its original Series A.<\/p>\n<p>Launched in 2018, the company is best-known for its e-scooter rentals but now pitches itself as a micro-mobility provider, offering a number of different transport devices. These include various e-scooter and e-bike models, in a bid to become a broader transport operator helping to re-shape urban transport and wean people off using cars.<\/p>\n<p>To date, Voi says it has 4 million registered users and has powered 14 million rides. More recently it has launched <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/14\/on-your-new-scooter\/\">new, more robust hardware<\/a> that has been designed to sustain the rigours of commercial e-bike sharing. The idea is that more suitable hardware will help e-scooter companies improve margins since more rides can be extracted from the life-span of each vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>On that note, Voi says it will use the new funding to develop &#8220;strong profitable businesses&#8221; in the 38 cities where it is already operating, as well as increase its R&amp;D spend to improve its technology platform and products. Earlier this year, the company announced that it is already profitable in the cities of Stockholm and Oslo.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Clearly, we feel we are on track to achieve this in more of our cities and that is our aim,&#8221; Voi co-founder and CEO Fredrik Hjelm tells me. &#8220;At this point, a key focus for us is to ensure we continue to increase the lifetime of our e-scooters, forge key partnerships and continue to work in those cities which provide the best conditions for a profitable e-scooter business&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Hjelm says that Voi&#8217;s version 2 scooters are projected to last over 18 months, which means the company should be in profit before it needs to raise again. However, he wouldn&#8217;t be drawn on when that might be.<\/p>\n<p>With regards to R&amp;D and improvements to the Voi platform, the company will continue to work on the lifetime of its e-scooters, in addition to improved repair management via integrating &#8220;predictive diagnostics&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Hjelm also says Voi is developing &#8220;AI-powered&#8221; fleet management and more generally the platform&#8217;s capability to support future product portfolio expansion. In other words, we can expect new micro-mobility device categories in the future.<\/p>\n",

This week, a lawsuit sparked a debate over the deployment of China&#8217;s pervasive facial recognition; meanwhile, in some good news, foreigners in China can finally experience cashless payment just like locals.<\/p>\n<h3>China&#8217;s first lawsuit against face scans<\/h3>\n<p>Many argue that China holds an unfair advantage in artificial intelligence because of its citizens&#8217; willingness to easily give up personal data desired by tech companies. But a handful of people are surely getting more privacy-conscious.<\/p>\n<p>This week, a Chinese law professor filed what looks like the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sixthtone.com\/news\/1004780\/chinese-professor-files-landmark-suit-against-facial-recognition-\">country&#8217;s first lawsuit against the use of AI-powered face scans<\/a>, according to Qianjiang Evening News, a local newspaper in the eastern province of Zhejiang. In dispute is the decision by a privately-owned zoo to impose mandatory facial recognition on admission control for all annual pass holders.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always been conservative about gathering facial biometrics data. The collection and use of facial biometrics involve very uncertain security risks,&#8221; the professor told the paper, adding that he nonetheless would accept such requirement from the government for the purpose of &#8220;public interest.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Both the government and businesses in China have aggressively embraced facial recognition in wide-ranging scenarios, be it to aid public security checks or speed up payments at supermarket checkouts. The technology will certainly draw more scrutiny from the public as it continues to spread. Already, the zoo case is garnering considerable attention. On Weibo, China&#8217;s equivalent of Twitter, <a href=\"https:\/\/s.weibo.com\/weibo?q=%23%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E4%BA%BA%E8%84%B8%E8%AF%86%E5%88%AB%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E6%A1%88%23\">posts about the suit<\/a> have generated some 100 million views and 10,000 comments in less than a week. Many share the professors&#8217; concerns over potential leaks and data abuse.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Scan and pay like a local<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The other technology that has become ubiquitous in China is cashless payments. For many years, foreign visitors without a Chinese bank account have not been able to participate in the scan-and-pay craze that&#8217;s received extensive coverage in the west. But the fences are now down.<\/p>\n<p>This week, two of the country&#8217;s largest payment systems announced almost at the same time that they are making it easier for foreigners to pay through their smartphones. Visitors can now pay at a selection of Chinese merchants after linking their overseas credit cards backed by Visa, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/mastercard\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"mastercard\">MasterCard, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> American Express, Discover Global Network or JCB to Tencent&#8217;s WeChat Pay.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is to provide travelers, holding 2.6 billion Mastercard cards around the world, with the ability to make simple and smart payments anytime, anywhere in China,&#8221; Mastercard said in a <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.mastercard.com\/asia-pacific\/press-releases\/mastercard-works-with-tencent-and-ant-financial-to-enable-new-payments-choices-across-china-for-international-visitors\/\">company statement<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/alipay-a757\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"alipay-a757\">Alipay, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Alibaba&#8217;s affiliate, now also allows foreign visitors to top up RMB onto a prepaid virtual card issued by Bank of Shanghai with their international credit or debit cards.

But the company, which has become synonymous with ride-hailing, was immediately put in the hot seat again. The relaunched feature noticeably <a href=\"https:\/\/mp.weixin.qq.com\/s\/GW8oC56eLAxHZNHGIJ8ECg\">included a curfew on women<\/a>, who are only able to carpool between 5 a.m. and 8 p.m. The public lambasted the decision as humiliating and discriminating against women, and Didi responded swiftly to<a href=\"https:\/\/mp.weixin.qq.com\/s\/uWmmjZ8iQ35P5cAIVB5pqw\"> extend the limit<\/a> to both women and men. The murders were a huge backlash for the company, and it&#8217;s since tried to allay the concerns. At this point, the ride-hailing giant simply can&#8217;t afford another publicity debacle.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The government moves to stamp out monopolistic practices of some of China&#8217;s largest e-commerce platforms<\/strong> ahead of Single&#8217;s Day, the country&#8217;s busiest shopping festival.

Strong ecosystems have great reservoirs of talent congregated close together, a culture built around helping one another on ambitious projects, and sufficient risk capital to ensure that interesting projects have the resources to get underway.<\/p>\n<p>Strip off the ecosystem layer though, and you are left with the actual, physical manifestation of a city or region \u2014 its housing, its transportation and mobility options, and its infrastructure. And if Charles Marohn\u2019s <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.strongtowns.org\/book\">Strong Towns: A Bottom-Up Revolution to Rebuild American Prosperity<\/a><\/em>\u00a0is any indication, a whole heck of a swath of America has little hope of ever tapping into the modern knowledge economy or creating the kind of sustainable growth that builds \u201cStrong Towns.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Across the country, Marohn sees evidence of what he dubs a \u201cMunicipal Ponzi scheme.\u201d Cities \u2014 armed with economic development dollars and consultants galore \u2014 focus their energies and budgets on new housing subdivisions as well as far-flung, auto-dependent office parks and strip malls, all the while ignoring the long-term debt, maintenance costs, and municipal burdens they are transferring to future generations of residents. \u201cThe growth creates an illusion of wealth, a broad, cultural misperception that the growing community is become [sic] stronger and more prosperous. Instead, with each new development, they become increasingly more insolvent,\u201d the author writes.<\/p>\n<p>He provides a multitude of examples, but few are as striking as that of Lafayette, Louisiana:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>As one example, the city of Lafayette, Louisiana, had 5 feet of pipe per person in 1949. By 2015, that had grown to 50 feet, an increase of 1,000%. They had 2.4 fire hydrants per 1,000 people in 1949, but by 2015, they had 51.3. This is a 2,140% increase. Over the same period, median household income in Lafayette grew just 160% from an inflation-adjusted $27,700 to $45,000. And if national trends hold locally in Lafayette, which they almost certainly do, household savings decreased while personal debt skyrocketed. Lafayette grew its liabilities thousands of times over in service of a theory of national growth, yet its families are poorer.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The author contextualizes just how weird the modern American suburb and community is in the grand sweep of human history, where co-location, walkability, and human-scale density weren\u2019t just norms, but necessities. The lack of thoughtful, dynamic planning that allows cities to adapt and evolve over time eventually comes to tear at the vitality of the town itself. \u201cOnly the richest country in the world could build so much and make such poor use of it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Marohn has spent decades in urban planning and also runs <a href=\"https:\/\/www.strongtowns.org\">Strong Towns<\/a>, a non-profit advocacy organization that tries to create more sustainable cities by attempting to guide the urban planning conversation toward better models of adaptable growth. He brings an authority to the topic that is heartening, and the book is absolutely on the right vector on how to start to think about urban planning going forward.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to his discussions around municipal finance, he makes the critical connections between urban planning and some of the most pressing challenges facing America today. He notes how the disintegration of tight-knit communities has exacerbated issues like drug abuse and mental health, and how the focus on big-box retail development has undermined smaller-scale entrepreneurship.<\/p>\n<p>Even more heartening in some ways is that the solutions are seemingly so easy. For example, one is to simply account for the true, long-term costs of infrastructure and economic development dollars, properly accounting for \u201cvalue per acre.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Yet, the flaws in the book are manifold, and I couldn\u2019t help but shake my head on numerous occasions at the extent to which movements to improve urban planning always seem to shudder on the weight of reality.<\/p>\n<p>Nowhere are those flaws more glaring than over the actual preferences of the residents of these cities themselves. As anyone who lives in San Francisco or Palo Alto understands, there is a serious contingent of NIMBYs who consistently vote against housing and density regardless of its effects on inequality or urban quality. Kim-Mai Cutler wrote <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2014\/04\/14\/sf-housing\/\">one of the definitive pieces on this topic<\/a> five years ago right here at TechCrunch, and yet, all these years later, the same dynamics still animate local politics in California and across the world.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"1FaUXZRbnc\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2014\/04\/14\/sf-housing\/\">How Burrowing Owls Lead To Vomiting Anarchists (Or SF&#8217;s Housing Crisis Explained)<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe title=\"&#8220;How Burrowing Owls Lead To Vomiting Anarchists (Or SF&#8217;s Housing Crisis Explained)&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2014\/04\/14\/sf-housing\/embed\/#?secret=1FaUXZRbnc\" data-secret=\"1FaUXZRbnc\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The prescriptions offered in <i>Strong Towns<\/i> are not only correct, they are almost incontestable. \u201cInstead of prioritizing maintenance based on condition or age, cities must prioritize based on financial productivity,\u201d Marohn writes. Public dollars should be spent on the highest-impact maintenance projects. Who is really against that?<\/p>\n<p>But, people are, as evidenced by city council meetings all across the United States and the simple ground truth that cities <i>don\u2019t<\/i> spend their dollars wisely. Whether your issue is housing, or climate change, or economic development, or inequality, the reality is that residents vote, and their voices are heard. That leads to Marohn writing:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>As a voter, as a property owner within a municipal corporation, as a person living cooperatively with my neighbors in a community, I can respect that some people prefer development styles that are financially ruinous to my city. My local government should not feel any obligation to provide those options, particularly at the price points people expect.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Yet, what should one do if 70-80% of a city\u2019s voters literally want to jump off the proverbial cliff?<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, should cities be responsive to their own voters? If San Francisco refuses to build more transit-oriented development and in the process exacerbates the climate change literally setting the Bay Area on fire, shouldn\u2019t the damn voters burn straight to the ground?<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Peak California liberalism is painting a mural honoring a 16 year-old climate activist within a year of her rise to prominence while spending the last 20 years refusing to build the dense multifamily housing we need to actually reduce our impact on the environment. <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/9w56sbtNRy\">https:\/\/t.co\/9w56sbtNRy<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Strang Gang (@ryxcommar) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ryxcommar\/status\/1193224897226518535?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 9, 2019<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>Marohn, who talks over several pages of his political evolution from Republican to complex libertarian communalist, never faithfully addresses this core problem with the <i>Strong Towns<\/i> thesis, or indeed, the entire activism around urban politics today. \u201cAmerican culture spends a lot of time debating what should be done, but hardly any time discussing who should make the decision,\u201d he writes. But we do \u2014 we did \u2014 discuss who makes the decisions, and our political systems actively respond to those decision-makers: local voters.<\/p>\n<p>American towns are in a perilous state \u2013 and that is precisely what people demanded and received. Marohn criticizes the planning profession for its lack of municipal sustainability, but seemingly is willing to substitute one group of far-flung experts with another to override the locals, presumably just with a different (better?) set of values.<\/p>\n<p>In the final analysis, <i>Strong Towns<\/i> the book gets the fundamentals right. But will it change minds? I\u2019m doubtful. It certainly doesn\u2019t offer a clear guidebook on how local leaders can start to educate their neighbors and build the kinds of voter blocs required to get local, democratic change on these issues. Ultimately, the book feels like a smaller footnote to the worthy work of <i>Strong Towns<\/i> the organization, which ultimately will drive the activity needed to build change on these issues.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"0fU3XEGJQD\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/02\/19\/algorithmic-zoning-could-be-the-answer-to-cheaper-housing-and-more-equitable-cities\/\">Algorithmic zoning could be the answer to cheaper housing and more equitable cities<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe title=\"&#8220;Algorithmic zoning could be the answer to cheaper housing and more equitable cities&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/02\/19\/algorithmic-zoning-could-be-the-answer-to-cheaper-housing-and-more-equitable-cities\/embed\/#?secret=0fU3XEGJQD\" data-secret=\"0fU3XEGJQD\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n",

Thank you for welcoming me into you inbox yet again.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I got some awesome responses to the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/03\/week-in-review-deletelinkedin\/\">#DeleteLinkedIn newsletter last week,<\/a> a few dozen emails (some of them angry) and plenty of tweets. Looking forward to chatting with some of you soon. On that note, I\u2019m currently in China for a TechCrunch event that we\u2019re having in Shenzhen and will be taking some time offline to travel a bit so I won\u2019t be arriving in your inboxes for the next two weeks. Week in Review will be back in your inboxes the weekend after Thanksgiving so you\u2019ll have to savor this newsletter until then.<\/p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\">If you&#8217;re reading this on the TechCrunch site, you can get this in your inbox <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/newsletter\">here<\/a>, and follow my tweets <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lucasmtny\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2>The big story<\/h2>\n<p>If there&#8217;s been a collective theme to some of the tech backlash of the past couple years, it&#8217;s been an evolving vision towards platform responsibility.<\/p>\n<p>Social media platforms have earned the lion&#8217;s share of this discussion to date. This has largely been due to the political landscape and gripes with both liberals and conservatives for how the site handles content policing. The prevailing libertarian view that tech platforms weren&#8217;t responsible for what was enabled by their platforms has fallen out of vogue.<\/p>\n<p>What continues to surprise me is how little accountability or expectations there still seems to be for marketplace platforms. Speech is a crucial part of the internet, but so is buying and selling and it shocks me how big some startups have been able to get without delivering some basic buyer protections.<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/lucasmtny\/1190027153099952128?s=20<\/p>\n<p>Through some great investigations from the Wall Street Journal, we&#8217;ve seen how fast and loose Amazon has been playing with third-party sellers getting free reign on the site. There have been countless stories of scammers infiltrating sites like Airbnb and eBay and operating in grey areas that allow them to rip off buyers. Last week, a reporter at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/43k7z3\/nationwide-fake-host-scam-on-airbnb\">Vice<\/a> delivered a scathing deep dive into a scam she fell victim to on Airbnb&#8217;s platform.<\/p>\n<p>This week, Airbnb announced that by next year they are pledging to verify all of their listings, something that seems more than a little overdue. Standing behind the properties being booked on their platform was seemingly the last box to check before driving to the IPO hoop.<\/p>\n<p>More from our <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/06\/airbnb-to-verify-all-of-its-listings\/\">story<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/airbnb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"airbnb\">Airbnb\u00a0<\/a>\u00a0properties will soon be verified for accuracy of photos, addresses, listing details, cleanliness, safety and basic home amenities, according to a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/news.airbnb.com\/in-the-business-of-trust\/\">company-wide email\u00a0<\/a>sent by Airbnb co-founder and chief executive officer Brian Chesky on Wednesday.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Airbnb is just another highly valued startup that has been trying to take the past of least resistance to outsized future value. Verifying properties is a difficult issue to brace. Sellers are certainly not the only scammers on Airbnb, and buyers abusing this new system is a guarantee. But keeping both sides in some sort of satisfaction equilibrium is Airbnb&#8217;s messy, god-given task.<\/p>\n<p>Airbnb has garnered more grumblings than most due to bad customer experiences, but it&#8217;s just a harbinger of what comes next. 2020 being a presidential election year in the U.S. means that the public might still be too busy with lambasting Zuckerberg to give marketplaces their due watchful eye in the near term, but the bell is tolling for these marketplaces and it&#8217;d be wise for them to pay attention to the writing on the wall.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-family: aktiv-grotesk, sans-serif; font-size: 1.625rem; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: -0.06px;\">Send me feedback<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-family: aktiv-grotesk, sans-serif; font-size: 1.625rem; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: -0.06px;\">on Twitter\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"font-family: aktiv-grotesk, sans-serif; font-size: 1.625rem; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: -0.06px; background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lucasmtny?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@lucasmtny<\/a><span style=\"font-family: aktiv-grotesk, sans-serif; font-size: 1.625rem; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: -0.06px;\">\u00a0or email<br \/>\n<\/span>lucas@techcrunch.com<\/h2>\n<p>On to the rest of the week\u2019s news.<\/p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1906491\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1906491\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1906491\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/GettyImages-1005682070-1.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"GettyImages 1005682070 1\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/GettyImages-1005682070-1.jpg 3000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/GettyImages-1005682070-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/GettyImages-1005682070-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/GettyImages-1005682070-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/GettyImages-1005682070-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/GettyImages-1005682070-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1906491\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Photo by Justin Sullivan\/Getty Images)<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<h2>Trends of the week<\/h2>\n<p>Here are a few big news items from big companies, with green links to all the sweet, sweet added context:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Twitter&#8217;s Saudi Arabian infiltration<\/strong><br \/>\nOne of the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/06\/saudi-arabia-reportedly-recruited-twitter-employees-to-steal-personal-data-of-activists\/\">wilder stories<\/a> this week was how Saudi Arabia reportedly lifted sensitive contact info from Twitter via employees at the company that they paid off.

The bug allowed them to take &#8220;full control&#8221; of the device if connected to a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot, said Brian Gorenc, director of Trend Micro&#8217;s Zero Day Initiative, which <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zerodayinitiative.com\/blog\/2019\/11\/6\/pwn2own-tokyo-2019-day-one-results\">put on the Pwn2Own contest<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The researchers tested their exploits in a radio-frequency shielding enclosure to prevent any outside interference.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This patch gap was a common factor in many of the IoT devices compromised during the contest,&#8221; Gorenc told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1910239\" style=\"width: 1011px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1910239\" class=\"breakout wp-image-1910239\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/echo-hackers.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1001\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/echo-hackers.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/echo-hackers.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/echo-hackers.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/echo-hackers.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/echo-hackers.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/echo-hackers.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1001px) 100vw, 1001px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1910239\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Amat Cama (left) and Richard Zhu (right), who make up Team Fluoroacetate.

That can have security implications for the device.<\/p>\n<p>When reached, Amazon said it was &#8220;investigating this research and will be taking appropriate steps to protect our devices based on our investigation,&#8221; but did not say what measures it would take to fix the vulnerabilities \u2014 or when.<\/p>\n<p>The Echo wasn&#8217;t the only internet-connected device at the show. Earlier this year the contest said hackers would have an opportunity to hack into a Facebook Portal, the social media giant&#8217;s video calling-enabled smart display. The hackers, however, could not exploit the Portal.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"QfHpvoifaQ\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/02\/smart-home-hub-flaws-unlock-doors\/\">Security flaws in a popular smart home hub let hackers unlock front doors<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe title=\"&#8220;Security flaws in a popular smart home hub let hackers unlock front doors&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/02\/smart-home-hub-flaws-unlock-doors\/embed\/#?secret=QfHpvoifaQ\" data-secret=\"QfHpvoifaQ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n",

Plus, most of the trailers were pretty underwhelming.<\/p>\n<p>For our 100th (!) episode, your regular <a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/original-content\/id1271763098\">Original Content podcast<\/a> hosts are joined by TechCrunch writer Sarah Perez to discuss all the Apple TV+ shows we\u2019ve sampled so far \u2014 \u201cFor All Mankind,\u201d \u201cSee,\u201d \u201cDickinson\u201d and even \u201cSnoopy in Space.\u201d And we were pleasantly surprised by what we found.<\/p>\n<p>Just a few episodes in, \u201cFor All Mankind\u201d (an alternate history in which the Soviet Union won the race to the moon) and \u201cSee\u201d (set in a world where everyone has lost the sense of sight) have turned some of us into fans. And even \u201cDickinson\u201d \u2014 which has the seemingly impossible task of telling Emily Dickinson&#8217;s story using modern slang\u2014 turns out to be a strange and watchable experiment.<\/p>\n<p>We save our most extensive discussion for the most high-profile title of the bunch: \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d which stars Jennifer Aniston as Alex Levy, longtime host of an AM news show also called \u201cThe Morning Show,&#8221; and Reese Witherspoon as local news anchor Bradley Jackson, whose confrontation at a coal mine protest ends up going viral right as Alex\u2019s show implodes, thanks to sexual misconduct allegations against her longtime co-host Matt Kessler (played Steve Carell).<\/p>\n<p>Obviously, the show has star power, and the leads are supported by talented and familiar faces like Billy Crudup, Mark Duplass and Gugu Mbatha-Raw.<\/p>\n<p>The performances are all strong, with Aniston and Witherspoon carrying the show: Aniston convincingly portrays a woman who\u2019s both devastated by the revelations of her on-screen partner\u2019s behavior and desperate to seize the opportunity that these revelations create. Witherspoon, meanwhile, adds complex shading to perhaps her trademark role as a spunky, ambitious upstart.<\/p>\n<p>The writing, on the other hand, is a bit uneven. There\u2019s an unfortunate tendency towards speechifying about big themes like The Role of Journalism in America \u2014 at times, it feels almost Sorkin-esque, but without the eloquence or snappiness of Aaron Sorkin\u2019s best dialogue.<\/p>\n<p>So far, though, the speeches have been balanced out by strong characterization and some satisfyingly dramatic twists.<\/p>\n<p>You can listen in the player below, <a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/original-content\/id1271763098\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">subscribe using Apple Podcasts<\/a>\u00a0or find us in your podcast player of choice.

The mini cheetah is a shrunk-down version of the Cheetah 3, a much larger and more expensive to produce robot that is far less light on its feet, and not quite so customizable.<\/p>\n<p>The mini cheetah was designed for Lego-like assembly using off-the-shelf part, as well as durability and relative low cost. It can walk both right-side up, and upside down, and its most impressive ability just might be the way it can manage a full backflip from a stand-still. It can also run at a speed of up to 5 miles per hour.<\/p>\n<p>Researchers working on the robot set out to build a team of them after demonstrating that first version back in May, and are now working with other teams at MIT to loan them out for additional research.<\/p>\n",

We&#8217;re also looking at the iOS bug-squashing release, a bunch of data about app install trends around the world, Google Play&#8217;s new loyalty program and what it means for developers, the continued scrutiny of Chinese apps by the U.S. government, and more.<\/p>\n<h2>Fast Facts<\/h2>\n<p>eMarketer remindS us that it recently put out <a href=\"https:\/\/on.emarketer.com\/Report-20191111-MobileApp-Branch-Report_DownloadPage.html\">a big report on app installs<\/a> with a ton of insights. It&#8217;s actually been live for a few months, but <em>ICYMI<\/em>, here are some of the key data points and highlights:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The average iPhone user in the U.S. downloaded <strong>47 apps in 2018,<\/strong> up from 44 in 2017.<\/li>\n<li>The average number of apps installed is rising \u2014 up 15% from 2016. In the U.S., Japan, South Korea, and Australia, users had <strong>more than 100 apps<\/strong> downloaded in 2018.<\/li>\n<li>Smartphone users spend the most time using their top 5 apps. In 2017,<strong> the top 5 accounted for 87% of usage. Now (Apr. 2019) it&#8217;s 83%<\/strong>. The No. 1 app had a 49% share of the time spent, now it&#8217;s 44%.<\/li>\n<li>The number of smartphone users in the U.S. will grow just 3% in 2019, compared with <strong>13.2% in India and 12.1% in Indonesia.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Related, <strong>app downloads grew 165% in India<\/strong> from 2016 to 2018. In China, 70%. In Indonesia, 55%. And in Brazil, 25%. The U.S. app downloads grew just 5%.<\/li>\n<li>In June 2019, the <strong>App Store had 1.8 million apps<\/strong> compared with <strong>Google Play&#8217;s 3.1 million<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>43% of iOS app install referrals came from Facebook<\/strong> properties, and only 6.6% came from Google properties.<\/li>\n<li>Apple Search Ads drove <strong>12% of non-organic installs<\/strong> in May 2019.<\/li>\n<li><strong>In-app video ads outperform display ads<\/strong>. Install-to-register rates for video were 35.1% in Q1<br \/>\n2019 on the Liftoff network, compared with 28.5% for display ads.<\/li>\n<li>App engagement <strong>drop-off rates<\/strong> after day one are the <strong>biggest in shopping apps<\/strong>. (25% engagement after the first day, but 8% at 30 days). Travel also sees a big drop-off.

Basically, Google will integrate its own detection systems with each partner&#8217;s scanning engine to help it uncover potential risks and threats. However, the fact that Google is now essentially outsourcing security to a partner ecosystem is an admission of failure, to some extent, about its abilities to keep the Play Store free from bad actors on its own.

All rentals that meet the company\u2019s new standards will be \u201cclearly labeled\u201d by December 15, 2020, he notes. Beginning next month, Airbnb will rebook or refund guests who check into rentals that do not meet the new accuracy standards.<\/p>\n<p>These changes, outlined fully <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/06\/airbnb-to-verify-all-of-its-listings\/\">here<\/a>, come as Airbnb preps for an IPO or a direct listing slated for 2020. The company was in need of some serious additions to its barely-there security measures and it also needed to make a grand gesture (or two) to Wall Street following multiple PR disasters over the last two weeks. Airbnb&#8217;s response to the recently-highlighted problems will help determine how it fares on the public market and given its quick and seemingly comprehensive response, money managers may be pleased.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1883994\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1883994\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-1883994\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/38818582982_37b9719635_o.jpg\" alt=\"38818582982 37b9719635 o\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/38818582982_37b9719635_o.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/38818582982_37b9719635_o.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/38818582982_37b9719635_o.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/38818582982_37b9719635_o.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/38818582982_37b9719635_o.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/38818582982_37b9719635_o.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1883994\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin 2017 in Berlin on 5 December 2017.

About 98% of these samples are typically normal and only the remaining 2% samples require intervention. \u201cWe were looking for ways to ensure our cytopathologists were able to find those 2% abnormal samples faster,\u201d explained Dr. Arnab Roy, Technical Lead for New Initiatives &amp; Knowledge Management at SRL Diagnostics.<\/p>\n<p>Cytopathologists at SRL Diagnostics studied digitally scanned versions of Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) slides, each comprising about 300-400 cells, manually and marked their observations, which were used as training data for Cervical Cancer Image Detection API.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1910207\" style=\"width: 651px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1910207\" class=\" wp-image-1910207\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Capture.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"641\" height=\"612\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Capture.png 748w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Capture.png?resize=150,143 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Capture.png?resize=300,286 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Capture.png?resize=680,649 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Capture.png?resize=32,32 32w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Capture.png?resize=50,48 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1910207\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A digitally scanned version of a Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) slide, which is used to train the AI model<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Then there was the challenge of subjectivity. \u201cDifferent cytopathologists examine different elements in a smear slide in a unique manner even if the overall diagnosis is the same. This is the subjectivity element in the whole process, which many a time is linked to the experience of the expert,\u201d reveals Dr. Roy.<\/p>\n<p>Manish Gupta, Principal Applied Researcher at Microsoft Azure Global Engineering, who worked closely with the team at SRL Diagnostics, said the idea was to create an AI algorithm that could identify areas that everybody was looking at and \u201ccreate a consensus on the areas assessed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Cytopathologists across multiple labs and locations annotated thousands of tile images of cervical smear. They created discordant and concordant notes on each sample image.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe images for which annotations were found to be discordant &#8212; that is if they were viewed differently by three team members &#8212; were sent to senior cytopathologists for final analysis,\u201d Microsoft wrote in a blog post.<\/p>\n<p>This week, the two <a href=\"https:\/\/news.microsoft.com\/en-in\/features\/srl-diagnostics-microsoft-consortium-ai-tool-diagnose-cervical-cancer\/\">revealed that their collaboration has started to show results<\/a>. SRL Diagnostics has started an internal preview to use Cervical Cancer Image Detection API. The Cervical Cancer Image Detection API, which runs on Microsoft\u2019s Azure, can quickly screen liquid-based cytology slide images for detection of cervical cancer in the early stages and return insights to pathologists in labs, the two said.<\/p>\n<p>The AI model can now differentiate between normal and abnormal smear slides with accuracy and is currently under validation in labs for a period of three to six months. It can also classify smear slides based on the seven-subtypes of cervical cytopathological scale, the two wrote in a blog post.<\/p>\n<p>During the internal preview period, the exercise will use more than half-a-million anonymized digital tile images. Following internal validation, the API will be previewed in external cervical cancer diagnostic workflows, including hospitals and other diagnostic centers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCytopathologists now have to review fewer areas, 20 as of now, on a whole slide liquid-based cytology image and validate the positive cases thus bringing in greater efficiency and speeding up the initial screening process,\u201d Microsoft wrote.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe API has the potential of increasing the productivity of a cytopathology section by about four times. In a future scenario of automated slide preparation with assistance from AI, cytopathologists can do a job in two hours what would earlier take about eight hours!\u201d Dr. Roy said.<\/p>\n<p>SRL Diagnostics-Microsoft consortium said they are hopeful their APIs could find application in other fields of pathology such as diagnosis of kidney pathologies and in oral, pancreatic and liver cancers. The consortium also aims to expand its reach with tie-ups with private players and governments and expand the reach of the model even in remote geographies where the availability of histopathologists is a challenge.<\/p>\n<p>The announcement this week is the latest example of Microsoft\u2019s ongoing research work in India. The world\u2019s second most populous nation has become a test bed for many American technology companies to build new products and services that solve local challenges as they look for their next billion users worldwide.<\/p>\n<p>Last week, Microsoft announced its AI project was helping <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/31\/driving-test-india-microsoft-hams\/\">improve the way driving tests are conducted in India<\/a>. The company has unveiled a score of tools for the Indian market in the last two years. Microsoft has previously developed tools to help farmers in India <a href=\"https:\/\/news.microsoft.com\/en-in\/features\/ai-agriculture-icrisat-upl-india\/\">increase their crop yields<\/a> and worked with hospitals to <a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.msdn.microsoft.com\/msind\/2017\/04\/18\/leveraging-cloud-artificial-intelligence-ai-to-transform-eyecare\/\">prevent avoidable blindness<\/a>. Last year, the company <a href=\"https:\/\/news.microsoft.com\/en-in\/microsoft-apollo-hospitals-partnership-national-clinical-coordination-committee-combating-cardiovascular-diseases\/\">partnered with Apollo Hospitals<\/a> to create an AI-powered API customized to predict risk of heart diseases in India.<\/p>\n<p>Also last year, the company also worked with cricket legend Anil Kumble to develop a tracking device that helps youngsters <a href=\"https:\/\/news.microsoft.com\/en-in\/features\/anil-kumble-spektacom-power-bat-microsoft-ai\/\">analyze their batting performance<\/a>. Microsoft has also <a href=\"https:\/\/news.microsoft.com\/en-in\/features\/icici-lombard-ai-enabled-car-inspection-app-india\/\">tied up with insurance firm ICICI Lombard<\/a> to help it process customers\u2019 repair claims and renew lapsed policies using an AI system.<\/p>\n",

And it includes a way to launch your favorite channels, which are organized in order of the most recently launched to make them easier to access. That way, if you always watch Netflix, you don&#8217;t have to scroll down to find it.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the tiny remote app includes voice search functionality. To activate, you just tap the voice icon, then say things like &#8220;Launch Hulu&#8221; or &#8220;search for comedies,&#8221; or even change sources, like &#8220;switch to HDMI 1&#8221; for your Roku TV, the company explains. This will work on Apple Watch versions 1 through 5.<\/p>\n<p>And if you have a Roku Ultra or a Roku TV with the Remote Finder functionality which uses an audible chime to locate a lost remote control in the couch cushions, you can also use the Roku Apple Watch app to signal your Roku remote to start making a noise.<\/p>\n<p>All these features will be familiar to anyone who has already used the Roku remote for smartphones, as the Apple Watch app is just a miniaturized version. The only thing it&#8217;s missing is the ability to stream The Roku Channels&#8217; free movies, but obviously that&#8217;s not a feature you&#8217;ll want on your wristwatch. (I mean&#8230;right?)<\/p>\n<p>To get the Roku Apple Watch app, you&#8217;ll need to download or update your Roku iOS app to the latest version (6.1.3), and the app will appear on your Watch as long as you haven&#8217;t disabled &#8220;Automatic App Install&#8221; in the Watch&#8217;s Settings.<\/p>\n",

This meant that the firm, which had initially aimed to raise <a href=\"https:\/\/asia.nikkei.com\/Business\/Companies\/China-s-TechCrunch-36Kr-files-for-Nasdaq-listing\">as much as $100 million<\/a>, settled for $20 million. A company top executive said that even as the offering is smaller, it has great confidence in its stock&#8217;s future performance.<\/p>\n<p>The nine-year-old Chinese company&#8217;s decision to list in the U.S., instead of doing so in Hong Kong especially during the ongoing trade war between the two nations also surprised many.<\/p>\n<p>In an <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/video\/steven-van-zandt-sopranos-prequel-225434121.html\">interview with Yahoo Finance<\/a> on Friday, 36Kr founder and co-chairman Cheng-Cheng Liu said the company decided to go public on Nasdaq because &#8220;our team thinks the U.S. stock market is one of the most matured markets in the world. Also, we have business outside of China.&#8221; In China itself, however, the company has yet to secure license to operate as an internet news service.<\/p>\n<p>In its prospectus, the company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1779476\/000104746919005518\/a2239638zf-1.htm\">wrote<\/a>, &#8220;lack of Internet news information license may expose us to administrative sanctions, which would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>36Kr provides financials on companies, market updates, and commentaries. It maintains an English website as well and makes money through ads and multiple subscription offerings. The company\u00a0could look to expand its business in North America in the future, said Liu. He also said that the company is betting that &#8220;the U.S. and China will be friends again.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Liu said the recent instances such disappointing debut of Uber and tremendous fall of We, which postponed its public debut, should not affect 36Kr&#8217;s performance because unlike other companies 36Kr is &#8220;not cash burning&#8221; and has been profitable. In the first half of 2019, 36Kr generated a revenue of\u00a0$29.4 million, a 179% year-over-year increase.<\/p>\n<p>The company, often called &#8220;<a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/crunchbase\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"crunchbase\">Crunchbase* <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> of China,&#8221;\u00a0counts Ant Financial, Matrix Partners China, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/e-ventures\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"e-ventures\">e.ventures, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and Infinity Ventures among its investors and has raised over $100 million in venture fund.

Also worth noting, 36Kr <a href=\"https:\/\/36kr.com\/p\/7880\">began as &#8220;TC Chinese&#8221;<\/a>\u00a0(link in Chinese) even though it had no affiliation with TechCrunch and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.cn\/2014\/01\/20\/36kr-stop-stealing-techcrunchs-posts\/\">plagiarized a number of TechCrunch articles<\/a> (link in Chinese).<\/p>\n",

To that end, next week Instagram will expand its test of hiding Like counts from everyone but a post&#8217;s creator to some users in the United States. But there are major questions about whether the change will hurt influencers.<\/p>\n<p>Mosseri revealed the plan at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/wired25-livestream-2019\/\">Wired25<\/a> conference today, saying Instagram &#8220;We <span class=\"s1\">have to see how it affects how people feel about the platform, how it affects how they use the platform, how it affects the creator ecosystem.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Instagram&#8217;s CEO explained that &#8220;<span class=\"s1\">The idea is to try to depressurize Instagram, make it less of a competition, and give people more space to focus on connect ing with the people they love and things that inspire them.&#8221; The intention is to<\/span><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0&#8220;reduce anxiety&#8221; and &#8220;reduce social comparison&#8221;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Elsewhere during the talk that also featured actor and CEO Tracie Ellis Ross, Mosseri discussed Instagram&#8217;s growing interest in shopping, and how it can provide new revenue streams to influencers. He also described Instagram&#8217;s three-pronged approach to well-being where it identifies and addresses acute problems such as hate speech, finds positions where it can lead as with fighting bullying, and rethinks fundamentals of how the platform works as with Like count hiding.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1910146\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Instagram-Hide-Like-Counter.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1010\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Instagram-Hide-Like-Counter.png 1205w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Instagram-Hide-Like-Counter.png?resize=150,148 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Instagram-Hide-Like-Counter.png?resize=300,296 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Instagram-Hide-Like-Counter.png?resize=768,757 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Instagram-Hide-Like-Counter.png?resize=680,670 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Instagram-Hide-Like-Counter.png?resize=32,32 32w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Instagram-Hide-Like-Counter.png?resize=50,50 50w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Instagram-Hide-Like-Counter.png?resize=64,64 64w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Instagram-Hide-Like-Counter.png?resize=96,96 96w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Instagram began <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/04\/30\/instagram-hidden-like-counter\/\">testing this in April<\/a> in Canada and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/17\/instagram-will-now-hide-likes-in-6-more-countries\/\">expanded it<\/a> to Ireland, Italy, Japan, Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand in July.<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/09\/02\/facebook-hidden-likes\/\"> Facebook started<\/a> a similar experiment in Australia in September.<\/p>\n<p>While it seems likely that making Instagram less of a popularity contest might aid the average user, Instagram has to be mindful that it doesn&#8217;t significantly decrease creators&#8217; or influencers&#8217; engagement and business success. These content makers are vital to Instagram&#8217;s success, since they keep their fan bases coming back day after day, even If\u00a0 users&#8217; friends are growing stale.<\/p>\n<p>A new study by <a href=\"https:\/\/hypeauditor.com\/\">HypeAuditor<\/a> reported by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.socialmediatoday.com\/news\/new-report-examines-the-impact-of-instagrams-hidden-likes-experiment-on-in\/566887\/\">Social Media Today<\/a> found that influencers across tiers of follower counts almost unanimously saw their Like counts fall in countries where the hidden Like count test was active. Likes fell 3% to 15% in all the countries for influencers with 5,000 to 20,000 followers.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1910152\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/hype2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"604\" height=\"340\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/hype2.png 604w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/hype2.png?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/hype2.png?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/hype2.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Only in Japan, and only for influencers with 1,000 to 5,000 or 100,000 to 1 million followers did the change lead to a boost in Likes &#8212; of about 6% in both groups. Meanwhile, influencers saw the biggest loss of Likes in the Brazilian market. Those trends could relate to how users in certain countries might feel more comfortable Liking something if they don&#8217;t know who else is too, while in other nations users might rely on more herd mentality to know what to Like.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1910155\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/hype4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"603\" height=\"339\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/hype4.png 603w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/hype4.png?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/hype4.png?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/hype4.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If Instagram finds the impact of the test to be too negative on influencers, it may not roll out the change. While Mosseri stated the company wasn&#8217;t afraid to hurt its own bottom line, impairing the careers of influencers may not be acceptable unless the positive impacts on well-being are significant enough.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<div id=\"fb-root\"><\/div>\n<p><script async=\"1\" defer=\"1\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" src=\"https:\/\/connect.facebook.net\/en_US\/sdk.js#xfbml=1&amp;version=v5.0\"><\/script><\/p>\n<div class=\"fb-video\" data-href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/wired\/videos\/426373741593446\" data-width=\"auto\">\n<blockquote cite=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/wired\/videos\/426373741593446\/\" class=\"fb-xfbml-parse-ignore\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/wired\/videos\/426373741593446\/\">Instagram CEO Announces Platform Will Test Hiding Likes in the US<\/a><\/p>\n<p>WATCH: Instagram CEO <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/adam-mosseri\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"adam-mosseri\">Adam Mosseri <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> announces that the platform will start hiding likes for US audiences starting next week.

Widodo said he wished to separate Indonesia\u2019s government from its business and economic hub in Jakarta. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">However, what would a move from Jakarta do to Indonesia\u2019s burgeoning startup economy?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Shifting administrative governmental hubs<\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">According to Widodo, studies have determined that the best site for the proposed new capital is between <\/span><span class=\"s1\">North Penajam Paser and Kutai Kertanegara, both located in East Kalimantan. The basis of this selection is due to studies highlighting the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.globalgovernmentforum.com\/indonesia-to-move-capital-from-jakarta-to-east-kalimantan\/\"><span class=\"s2\">region\u2019s relative protection<\/span><\/a> from natural disasters, especially when compared to other regions. This would definitely be a benefit for the governmental heart of Indonesia, ensuring continuous administrative functions in a disaster-prone region. Other governments have separated administrative centers from their economic hubs with varying degrees of success, with some examples being Brazil\u2019s creation of Bras\u00edlia, as well as Korea\u2019s projected move from Seoul to Sejong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">What is most interesting to note from prior examples is that these newer branched-out cities are non-surprisingly, heavily government-centric. In Bras\u00edlia, roles tied to the government make up nearly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.internations.org\/go\/moving-to-brasilia\/working\"><span class=\"s2\">40%<\/span><\/a> of all jobs, while in Sejong, a lack of facilities like public transit and commercial mall space cause many to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usnews.com\/news\/cities\/articles\/2019-06-04\/sejong-south-koreas-new-administrative-capital-city-draws-critics\"><span class=\"s2\">commute<\/span><\/a> into Sejong for government work, instead of permanently settling in the area. Given the semi-undeveloped nature of East Kalimantan, these anecdotes are quite troubling if the government is actually moving to North Penajam Paser or Kutai Kertanegara.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">These facts raise the question of economic impacts of such governmental moves. In fact, one may even opine that while these moves do allow for governmental growth, ultimately, they may hurt the country economically due to a divestment between both government and economic hubs. In this specific instance, it is most important to analyze the impact of such a move on Indonesia\u2019s startup economy, as the nation is one the world\u2019s leaders in startup growth.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Indonesia\u2019s startup economy<\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Indonesia has emerged as a startup hub within Southeast Asia in recent years, with its population of over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bps.go.id\/\"><span class=\"s2\">260 million<\/span><\/a> marking it as the world\u2019s fourth-most populous country. Additionally, Indonesia\u2019s mobile-first population has enabled the full embrace of the internet era, with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/eladnatanson\/2019\/05\/14\/indonesia-the-new-tiger-of-southeast-asia\/#41c9de0276ce\"><span class=\"s2\">95%<\/span><\/a> of all internet users in Indonesia connected to the web via a mobile device.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Similarly, startup growth has boomed in the island archipelago, with several Indonesian-based unicorns disrupting local, regional, and global economies. Softbank-backed ecommerce giant Tokopedia is currently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2019-10-15\/softbank-backed-tokopedia-in-talks-for-pre-ipo-funding-round\"><span class=\"s2\">in talks<\/span><\/a>\u00a0for a pre-IPO funding round, while emerging super-app Gojek controls significant portions of the ride-sharing industry in Asia, simultaneously expanding into\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.techinasia.com\/talk\/go-jek-super-apps-wechat\"><span class=\"s2\">separate industries<\/span><\/a>\u00a0to include digital payments, food delivery, and even\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/09\/25\/indonesias-ride-hailing-giant-gojek-launches-video-streaming-service-goplay\/?renderMode=ie11\"><span class=\"s2\">video-streaming<\/span><\/a>. Additionally, online travel portal Traveloka (in which Expedia has a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/07\/28\/expedia-invests-350m-in-traveloka\/2017\/07\/28\/expedia-invests-350m-in-traveloka\/\"><span class=\"s2\">minority stake<\/span><\/a>) has recently\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2019-09-26\/southeast-asia-s-no-1-travel-app-jumps-on-fintech-bandwagon\"><span class=\"s2\">entered<\/span><\/a> the financial services space, furthering its impact within Asia. These specific examples of high-growth startups demonstrate a population hungry for innovation, further driving the developing startup economy.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>",

He complemented Facebook&#8217;s efforts to build ways of catching bad actors even if they&#8217;re shielded by encryption. That includes digital literacy initiatives in Brazil and India ahead of elections, and offering forwarding systems for sending questionable information to fact checkers. &#8220;I think there are pros and cons with these systems and I&#8217;m not a hard-liner on any one of them,&#8221; Cox said, and noted that what Facebook is building is &#8220;resonant with what people want.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Cox was asked about the major debate about whether Facebook should allow political advertising. &#8220;We think political advertising can be good and helpful. It often favors up and comers versus incumbents.&#8221; Still, on fact-checking, he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m a big fan,&#8221; even though Facebook isn&#8217;t applying that to political ads.

With an ISA, students avoid paying tuition upfront or taking out private loans, instead paying a percentage of their income for a time after graduation after they&#8217;re earning a minimum income.<\/p>\n<p>The model aligns education providers with students&#8217; career outcomes, and one startup is staking a claim to be the leader in the space; <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/kenzie-academy\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"kenzie-academy\">Kenzie Academy, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> a year-long program with a physical campus in Indianapolis \u2014 and a student body that&#8217;s 66 percent online \u2014 announced a partnership with Community Investment Management (CIM) earlier this week that provides $100 million in debt to cover the operating costs associated with students who defer payment through ISAs.<\/p>\n<p>Kenzie co-founder and CEO Chok Ooi says that core to Kenzie&#8217;s mission is the goal that its graduates &#8220;can stay in the heartland and attract more jobs so that someone coming out of the Midwest no longer has to move to Silicon Valley or New York to have a successful career in tech.&#8221; This $100 million is one of the largest commitments yet to financing ISAs and Kenzie is using it to recruit a more diverse population of students who may not be able to afford tuition or qualify for student loans otherwise.<\/p>\n<p>I interviewed Ooi to understand how Kenzie differentiates itself from competitors, how it has iterated its model to improve retention and job placement and how he expects the ISA market to evolve over the next couple years. Here&#8217;s the transcript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity:<\/p>\n<p><b>Eric Peckham: The landscape of software developer training programs is crowded. Where did you see an opportunity to do something different, and how do you position Kenzie relative to others in the market?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Chok Ooi:<\/strong> My co-founder came from Galvanize, so we observed firsthand the proliferation of tech and coding boot camps. These are typically short-term, three-to-five month programs and they tend to do well serving people with college degrees. I would say that they are disrupting the masters&#8217; program space. We saw a major gap in programs that serve a much larger demographic of people who are much earlier in their development. People who never went to college, or did a little bit of college and dropped out, or just never had a professional work experience. A three-month training is insufficient to get them to a point where they could land a technical job and be successful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We saw an opportunity to bring high-quality tech education to the American heartland that is 12 months in length. For about two-thirds of our students, this is their first post-secondary credential training.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are giving them not just the technical skills, but elements from a traditional four-year college as well, like critical thinking, problem-solving and communication skills.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Compared to those other bootcamps or training programs, is Kenzie targeting different job outcomes for its graduates?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We did a survey of our students that asked them to name the top five tech companies they desired to work for. None of the Silicon Valley companies made the list other than Salesforce. Indianapolis is the second largest Salesforce office outside of San Francisco. The rest of the companies our students named were companies like DMI and Zylo that people in Silicon Valley don&#8217;t hear about but are doing very well in the Midwest. Their friends work there. They&#8217;re a fabric of the community. If we really want to create job opportunities for the rest of America, we cannot adopt the Silicon Valley mindset.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1910064\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1910064\" class=\"breakout wp-image-1910064\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Chok-headshot.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Kenzie Academy co-Founder and CEO Chok Ooi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Chok-headshot.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Chok-headshot.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Chok-headshot.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Chok-headshot.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Chok-headshot.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Chok-headshot.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1910064\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kenzie Academy co-founder and CEO Chok Ooi.<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><b>So how do you evaluate technical aptitude and critical thinking in the admissions process?

What have you learned in order to make that more effective?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to founding Kenzie, I started a company nine years ago called AglityIO. The model for AgilityIO was similar to companies like Andela. We were trying to solve the talent crunch in the Bay Area by recruiting and training people with the raw talent in Vietnam. Today, that company works with Google, Uber, NerdWallet, Meetup.com and 150 other tech companies. So I\u2019ve experience in developing processes to identify raw talent in this context.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As people are doing the online assessments, we collect data points of how long it takes for them to solve the problem, what their different decision points are and things like that. Then as they get enrolled in Kenzie, we continue to collect attendance data, grades, and then placement data and use that to look at success and failure cases. We constantly refine our assessment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Are you seeing any particular pattern or cluster in the applications you\u2019re receiving or the candidates you\u2019re accepting in terms of prior field of employment or aspect of their background?<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>",

            "rendered": "<p id=\"speakable-summary\">This July, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/facebook\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/tech.fb.com\/npe-team-from-facebook\/\">announced<\/a> a new division called NPE Team which would build experimental consumer-facing apps, allowing the company to try out new ideas and features to see how people would react. It soon thereafter <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/15\/facebook-snags-former-vine-gm-to-run-product-for-its-new-experimental-app-division-npe-team\/\">tapped former Vine GM Jason Toff<\/a> to join the team as a product manager. The first apps to emerge from the NPE Team have now quietly launched. One, <a href=\"https:\/\/bumpapp.io\/\">Bump<\/a>, is a chat app that aims to help people make new friends through conversations, not appearances. Another, <a href=\"https:\/\/auxapp.com\/\">Aux<\/a>, is a social music listening app.<\/p>\n<p>Aux seems a bit reminiscent of an older startup, Turntable.fm, that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2013\/11\/22\/turntable-fm-shutting-down-so-company-can-focus-on-turntable-live-events-platform\/\">closed its doors in 2013<\/a>. As in Turntable.fm, the idea with Aux is that of a virtual DJ&#8217;ing experience where people instead of algorithms are programming the music. This concept of crowdsourced DJ&#8217;ing also caught on in years past with radio stations <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2013\/01\/18\/radio-freaks-out-first-cox-media-owned-radio-station-turns-over-control-to-listeners-247\/97x-vote\/\">that put their audiences in control of the playlist<\/a> through their mobile app.<\/p>\n<p>Later, streaming music apps like Spotify <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/apps\/2015\/12\/16\/spotifys-new-feature-will-dj-your-next-party-for-you\/\">experimented<\/a> with party playlists, and <a href=\"https:\/\/jukestar.mobi\/\">various<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/festify.rocks\/\">startups<\/a> launched their own guest-controlled playlists.<\/p>\n<p>The NPE Team&#8217;s Aux app is a slightly different take on this general idea of people-powered playlists.<\/p>\n<p>The app is aimed at school-aged kids and teens who join a party in the app every day at 9 PM. They then choose the songs they want to play and compete for the &#8220;AUX&#8221; to get theirs played first. At the end of the night, a winner is chosen based on how many &#8220;claps&#8221; are received.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1910085\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/aux-stitched.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"290\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/aux-stitched.jpg 6490w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/aux-stitched.jpg?resize=150,64 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/aux-stitched.jpg?resize=300,128 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/aux-stitched.jpg?resize=768,328 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/aux-stitched.jpg?resize=680,290 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/aux-stitched.jpg?resize=50,21 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As the app describes it, Aux is a &#8220;DJ for Your School&#8221; &#8212; a title that&#8217;s a bit confusing, as it brings to mind music being played over the school&#8217;s intercom system, as opposed to a social app for kids <em>who attend school<\/em> to use in the evenings.<\/p>\n<p>Aux launched on August 8, 2019 in Canada, and has less than 500 downloads on iOS, according to data from Sensor Tower. It&#8217;s not available on Android. It briefly ranked No. 38 among all Music apps on the Canadian App Store on October 22, which may point to some sort of short campaign to juice the downloads.<\/p>\n<p>The other new NPE Team app is Bump, which aims to help people &#8220;make new friends.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Essentially an anonymous chat app, the idea here is that Bump can help people connect by giving them icebreakers to respond to using text. There are no images, videos or links in Bump &#8212; just chats.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Based on the App Store screenshots, the app seems to be intended for college students. The screenshots show questions about &#8220;the coolest place&#8221; on campus and where to find cheap food. A sample chat shown in the screenshots mentions things like classes and roommate troubles.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1910083\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/bump-stitched.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"368\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/bump-stitched.jpg 4968w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/bump-stitched.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/bump-stitched.jpg?resize=300,162 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/bump-stitched.jpg?resize=768,416 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/bump-stitched.jpg?resize=680,368 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/bump-stitched.jpg?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There could be a dating component to the app, as well, as it stresses that Bump helps people make a connection through &#8220;dialog versus appearances.&#8221; That levels the playing field a bit, compared with other social apps &#8212; and certainly dating apps &#8212; where the most attractive users with the best photos tend to receive the most attention.<\/p>\n<p>Chats in Bump take place in real time, and you can only message in one chat at a time. There&#8217;s also a time limit of 30 seconds to respond to messages, which keeps the chat active. When the chat ends, the app will ask you if you want to keep in touch with the other person. Only if both people say yes will you be able to chat with them again.<\/p>\n<p>Bump is available on both <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/ca\/app\/bump\/id1474661920\">iOS<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?hl=en&#038;id=com.npe.products.bump\">Android<\/a> and is live in Canada and the Philippines. Bump once ranked as high as No. 252 in Social Networking on the Canadian App Store on September 1, 2019, according to Sensor Tower. However, it&#8217;s not ranking at all right now.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s interesting is that only one of these NPE Team apps, Bump, discloses in its App Store description that the NPE Team is from Facebook. The other, Aux, doesn&#8217;t mention this. However, both do point to an App privacy policy that&#8217;s hosted on Facebook.com for those who go digging.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not too different from how Google&#8217;s in-house app incubator, Area 120, behaves. Some of its apps aren&#8217;t clear about their affiliation with Google, save for a link to Google&#8217;s privacy policy. It seems these companies want to see if the apps succeed or fail on their own merit, not because of their parent company&#8217;s brand name recognition.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook hasn&#8217;t said much about its plans for the NPE Team beyond the fact that they will focus on new ways of building community and may be shut down quickly if they&#8217;re not useful.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook previously confirmed the existence of these apps to <a href=\u201c https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/articles\/facebooks-app-factory-aims-for-teens-with-two-new-apps\u201d>The Information.<\/a><\/p>\n",
